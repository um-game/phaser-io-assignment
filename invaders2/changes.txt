Most of the feedback we recieved is that the game was too hard. 
To alleviate this, we simply slowed the enemies down, made them fire a bit less and gave the player the ability to gain extra lives by collecting limes. Additionally, the player can also collect lemons for extra points.

One thing to note is that I could not make the little ships properly display the correct number of lives, however, the actual number is correct as well as the logic.
